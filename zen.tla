-------------------------------------------- MODULE zen --------------------------------------------
\* Imported modules used in this specification
EXTENDS Naturals, FiniteSets, Sequences, TLC

\* Set of node ids (all master-eligible nodes)
CONSTANTS Nodes

\* The constant "Nil" denotes a place-holder for a non-existing value
CONSTANTS Nil

CONSTANTS
  Unicast,
  Join, \* only models request
  AppendEntries,
  Apply \* only models request

CONSTANTS
  Pinging, \* initial state, pinging is done in this state
  Become_Follower, \* pinging established another node should be master, send join request to that node
  Follower, \* node succefully joined a cluster
  Become_Master, \* pinging established this node should be master, wait for joins
  Master \* node successfully became a master (received enough joins and starts publishing CS)

----

\* The following describes the variable state of the model.

\* Set of in-flight requests and responses sent between nodes.
VARIABLE messages

\* For simplicity we assume that each cluster state update chooses a new unique value to be added
\* to the cluster state. This allows us to check that nodes have a consistent view on CS updates.
VARIABLE nextClientValue

\* The following variables capture state on a per-node basis (maps with domain nodes).

(*
  Possible discovery states:
  - pinging
  - become_follower
  - follower
  - become_master
  - master
*)
VARIABLE discoState

(*
  cluster state: record containing
    subset of nodes that are part of cluster, and a master node field which is either a node id or Nil
    also a field for some data that is currently stored, maybe a sequence of client events (which are just a number increased on every client request)
    and cluster state version field (and make sure version is incremented...)
    as well as the term with which this CS was published
*)
VARIABLE publishedState \* used by disco module, persisted whenever updated
VARIABLE term \* used by disco module, persisted
VARIABLE votedFor \* used by disco module, persisted
VARIABLE appliedState \* state visible to the other modules on the node

----

\* Return the minimum value from a set, or undefined if the set is empty.
Min(s) == CHOOSE x \in s : \A y \in s : x <= y

\* Return the maximum value from a set, or undefined if the set is empty.
Max(s) == CHOOSE x \in s : \A y \in s : x >= y 

\* Remove request from the set of messages and add response instead
Reply(response, request) == messages' = {response} \cup (messages \ {request})
